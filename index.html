		<h1> Checkers Game</h1>
		<h3>2 Player Grid Game</h3>
		<p>
		Checkers is a classic board game which requires you to stay sharp and plan ahead. The goal of this game is to take all of your opponents pieces by diagonally jumping over vulnerable pieces. You can only move in one direction, unless you manage to get one of your pieces to the other side of the board. Upon reaching your opponents side of the board, your piece will be crowned king. King pieces can move in any direction and pose a serious threat to your opponent. Devise a strategy and play against the computer or a friend and see if you have what it takes to achieve a clean sweep in this fun online strategy game for kids!<br /><br />
